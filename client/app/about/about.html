  Welcome to card.ed, the intelligent study tool! Card.ed is designed to maximize your brain's capabilities to retain and memorize things, whether it be a new language or an abstract mathematical theory.

    Card.ed is based on two learning principles: spaced repetition and good old 'recite and repeat'.

    Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent reviews of previously learned material based on difficulty. In addition, multiple studies have shown that reciting and repeating help to better anchor your learning knowledge by using the sense of speech.
