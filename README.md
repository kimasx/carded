# Carded
**an intelligent study tool**

### About
Carded is online flash-cards that is inspired by Anki.
It uses spaced repetition and speech-recognition to help you
maximize your studying. I envisioned Carded as a tool to help
you study languages. Because of its speech recognition tool,
it is an easy and an effective when trying to learn and practice
foreign languages.

### Technology
*Back-End*
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose (ORM)

*Front-End*
- AngularJS
- UI-Bootstraps

### Future Plans
- I still need to some UX/UI. Those will be updated accordingly.
- Need to fix a bug where a blank card shows up when no card should.

The app is live at http://carded.herokuapp.com.
The styling got messy when it was deployed to Heroku, so git clone the app for the prettier Carded.
