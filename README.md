the intelligent study tool

# About

Carded is an online flash-card tool that is inspired by Anki.
It is based on two principles to help maximize your studying habits:
* Spaced Repetition
* Recite and Repeat

Spaced repeition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing 
intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material 
in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.

Studies also have shown that reciting out aloud when studying helps to retain
your knowledge.
