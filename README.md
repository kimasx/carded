# Carded
**an intelligent study tool**

### About
Carded is online flash-cards that is inspired by Anki.
It uses spaced repetition and speech-recognition to help you
maximize your studying. I envisioned Carded as a tool to help
you study languages. Because of its speech recognition tool,
it is an easy and an effective when trying to learn and practice
foreign languages.
