# Carded
**an intelligent study tool**

### About
Carded is online flash-cards that is inspired by Anki.
It uses spaced repetition and speech-recognition to help you
maximize your studying. I envisioned Carded as a tool to help
you study languages. Because of its speech recognition tool,
it is an easy and an effective when trying to learn and practice
foreign languages.

### Technology
*Back-End*
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose (ORM)

*Front-End*
- AngularJS
- UI-Bootstraps
- Flat-UI
- [Google's Web Speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html)

### Future Plans
- If anyone has feature recommendations, feel free to reach out!!


The app is live at http://carded.herokuapp.com.
The styling got messy when it was deployed to Heroku because Bower didn't support Flat-UI.
Git clone the app for the prettier Carded.
